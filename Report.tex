\section{Introduction}

As presented in the subject, the goal of this project is to use a spark infrastructure inside docker containers to simulate a cluster of virtual machines. \\

In our case, we will execute a wordcount application according to several scenarios and counting different size of text, then we will measure and compare the performances of different architectures to figure where the improvement or non improvement comes from.

\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Scenario 1 : One Spark container running locally}

\subsection{Scenario 2 : Several Spark containers running with one master and several slaves}

\subsection{Scenario 3 : Same as previous + one HDFS container}

\subsection{Scenario 4 : Same as previous + several HDFS containers}
